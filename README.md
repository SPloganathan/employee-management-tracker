## Description 
    
*The what, why, and how:* 
      
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). In this project I have build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Usage

* On starting the application, we are presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update employee role, update employee manager, view budget utilized by each department, and view employees by manager.
* On choosing 'view all departments', we are presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
* On choosing 'view all roles', we are presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.
* On choosing 'view all employees', we are presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
* On choosing 'add a department', we are prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.
* On chooisng 'add a role', we are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.
* On choosing 'add an employee', we are prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
* On chooisng 'update an employee role', we are prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
* On choosing 'update employee manager', we are prompted to select an employee to update and a manager to assign and the information is updated in the database.
* On choosing 'view budget utilized by each department', we are presented with formatted table showing department and budget(the combined salaries of all employees in that department).
* On choosing 'view employees by manager', we are prompted to select a manager and we are presented with a table showing id, first name and last name.
